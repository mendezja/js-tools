## Comparison with React

### Similarities

- Both react and vue use a virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is the representation of the UI that is kept in memory. It is synced with the real DOM when data in the UI is updated. It was pioneered by the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) team and used in a number of JavaScript frameworks.
